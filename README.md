# Artfinder Scraper

This project will crawl every artwork listed on Lizzie Butler's Artfinder shop, capture detailed metadata from each artwork page, and produce a spreadsheet plus downloaded imagery summarizing the collection. Upcoming modules in `artfinder_scraper/scraping/` will coordinate listing pagination, extract detail page content, normalize data, download media, and assemble spreadsheet outputs backed by typed models and runnable workflows.
