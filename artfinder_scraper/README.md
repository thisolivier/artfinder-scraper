# artfinder_scraper Package

This package will contain the scraping logic, tests, and storage helpers for the Artfinder project. The `scraping` subpackage will be populated with indexers, extractors, downloaders, spreadsheet utilities, normalization helpers, typed models, browser helpers, and a runner to orchestrate flows. The `tests` package will house unit and integration coverage for those components, while `data/` and `out/` will persist input caches and generated artifacts.
